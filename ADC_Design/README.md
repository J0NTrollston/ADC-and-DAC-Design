### Objectives or Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create an ADC from scratch which will be used with an Arduino Uno. Instead of using an ADC from an IC, we can appreciate the structure of how an ADC works and the different types. The first implementation that will design will be the Flash ADC as it is fast and simple.
