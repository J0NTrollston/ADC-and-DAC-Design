# ADC and DAC Design

In this repository you will find my implementation of an ADC and DAC. After preliminary designs, breadboard prototypes are tested on a breakboard then to a PCB created within Altium. The ADC will be implemented in 2 different designs. First, creating a Flash ADC with 2-bit resolution. After testing, the design will be upgraded to 4-bit resolution and finalized onto a PCB. The second implementation will be the SAR ADC which will move through the same objectives as the Flash ADC. The DAC will be worked on between the two ADC designs as the SAR ADC uses a DAC to determine the analog voltage level.
